# Recursive SINDY EULER LAGRANGE (R-SIEL)
R-SIEL: Is a new algorithm for discovering dyanmic equations of serial manipulators.
The algorithm was applied on three different robots: ABB SCARA, UR5, and KUKA KR4 AGILUS

Contents:
* The MATLAB SIMULINK model for each robot.
* The generated libraries for each robot and the corresponding data-sets.
* The code that is used to compare the discovered dynamic model of the proposed a lgorithm with simulation data and Euler Lagrange Equations.  

Dependencies:
* MATLAB R2022b
* SIMULINK
* Multi body dynamics toolbox

The data sets for all robots can be found through the following link:
